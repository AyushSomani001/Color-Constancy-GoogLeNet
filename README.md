The code is designed for MATLAB R2017b with Neural Networks Toolbox. It should also work with other recent versions.
Running the code requires having installed pre-trained GoogLeNet. (Can be installed within MatLab using Add-On explorer, or externaly from [File Exchange](https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/64456-deep-learning-toolbox-model-for-googlenet-network))
